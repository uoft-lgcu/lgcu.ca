### LGCU committee members data file

# These entries are intended to be used with the lingsite filter in the
# committees.md page (and other places that committee members might need to be
# listed).
# That filter is defined in _plugins/lingsite_filter.rb if you need to edit it.

# NOTE: If the member's department name (the one they are listed under on the
# dept website) is different from the actual name they go by, add a dept_name
# entry after the name entry, e.g.:
#
# president1:
#   name: The Big Man Noam
#   dept_name: Noam Chomsky
#
# This will display the name as "The Big Man Noam" on our site, but link to the
# page for Noam Chomsky on the department site.

# NOTE: If a position is vacant, enter "(vacant)" in the name field.
