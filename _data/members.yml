# How to make an entry:
# Use the format:
role1:
  name: "Preferred Name"
  fullname: "Departmentwebsite Name"
# Place the member's preferred name in the "name:" location (this is what will appear in text and metatext on the LGCU website)
# Place the member's name as it appears on the department website in the "fullname:" location (this will ensure that links to their contact information 
# function appropriately)
# If the member's preferred name is the name that appears on the department website, use the same name in both locations.

# Note: when updating, if the number of individuals who have a role changes (increasing or decreasing), updates will also have to be made to the "committees" page.
# New additions will not otherwise be listed on the committees page. Decreasing the number will probably just result in some excess commas.
# Note: where relevant, the contact person for each committee should be listed in the "role1" variable
