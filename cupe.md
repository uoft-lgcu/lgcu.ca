**NOTE: The information on this page is very old. We are hoping to update it very soon, but in the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact a steward.**

If you have received an employment position as a TA, grader, or course instructor, you are a member of a labour union on campus. This means that you have rights, protections, and benefits as a worker. Contract academic positions at the U of T are unionized as CUPE Local 3902. As graduate students, we are specifically members of CUPE 3902 Unit 1. Sign a union card at your first TA training session. See this introductory letter from the Union.

Please note that you are legally defined as a member of the union regardless of your personal stance on unions. You receive the rights and benefits of a union member, and have union dues deducted from your wages, even if you do not sign a union card. You are a member of the union as soon as your contract begins, and remain a member until a full year after the end of your most recent employment contract. (This is so that you remain a member even over summer break or while on leave.)

# Structure

CUPE 3902 is a large union representing over 8000 members across the university. The union is headed by a ten-person executive committee, and members in individual departments act as stewards/liaisons to better communicate the needs and interests of members to the executive on a regular basis. Meetings are held regularly over the term to discuss union-wide and unit-specific business.

The union is composed of the following five units:

- Unit 1: Postdocs and students (graduate or undergraduate) who have teaching positions.
- Unit 2: Academic workers at Victoria College.
- Unit 3: (Non-student) sessional/contract instructors.
- Unit 4: Academic workers at St. Michael's College
- Unit 5: Postdoctoctoral fellows funded by the U of T.

Decisions are made by member vote at meetings or at physical polling locations. There will be at least one vote every year to elect the executive committee; there may be more (e.g. referenda, pro-tem positions, strike votes, or contract ratification).

There are a number of caucuses and action groups to discuss particular issues (e.g. International Students' Caucus, Women's Caucus, Queer Caucus, Mental Health Action Committee). You are welcome (indeed, invited!) to participate in any of these. Follow the 3902 digest or contact a steward to find out how to get involved.

# Unit 1 protections and benefits

The union bargains a contract that applies collectively to all Unit 1 employees. This collective agreement outlines procedures and protections against unreasonable requests and overwork, as well as defining things like our wages and benefits. Below is a summary of some relevant benefits; see the 3902 website for details.

- A maximum of 200 contract hours can be included in funding package amounts. Additional work must grant you additional pay.
- Entitlement to 5 more years of guaranteed work after receiving work in PhD year 1 ("subsequent appointments"). You should receive information about this in May. You can postpone one year in the case of e.g. a research trip.
- Financial assistance funds (funding top-ups, tuition assistance post-funding, childcare assistance, UHIP fee assistance). Expect to apply for these in the winter/spring. â€¢ Paid training time (first time TA, first time instructor, new course/tutorial category).
- Leaves: academic conferences, thesis defense, union service, pregnancy/childbirth, new parental status, serious illness or injury, gender reassignment surgery, bereavement.
- Supplementary health insurance (see the Health page).
- Protection from harassment by any party in your workplace (the university).

(\* This amount will decrease over the life of the current agreement.)

You are also entitled to rights laid out in the Employment Standards Act. Relevant documents, including the full collective agreement, members' manual, DDAH forms, training request forms, and workload review forms, can be found here.

Our current agreement expires on December 31, 2017. When bargaining for a new contract, we have the right to strike. Unit 1 went on strike in 2000 and 2015.

# Stewards

Find the current 3902 stewards for the linguistics department on the Committees page.

Please feel comfortable going to these people to discuss any questions you have about TA work, funds and benefits, your rights as an employee, any issues with hiring/overwork/running out of hours, or any problems that you have with the way an instructor or student is treating you. Always speak to someone if it feels like a matter of personal safety. The stewards will be your contact people to resolve conflicts, either formally or informally, and will know the best method to take or be able to steer you to someone who can better advise you.

An issue may arise that our contract protects you against. You have the right to file a complaint or grievance if your rights as an employee have been violated. You have the right to steward representation or accompaniment in a meeting if you would like to bring a complaint to the department. The first step in any complaint or grievance is to take it up with the course instructor, then with the Undergraduate Advisor and Department Chair. Historically, problems in our department have been resolved at this level, but there are additional measures if department-internal discussion does not resolve the problem to your satisfaction.

# Preventing overwork for hourly contracts

Our contract requires instructors to provide you with an initial Description of Duties and Allocation of Hours (DDAH) form that lays out your expected TA duties for the course and how many hours you might expect to use for each task. It also requires instructors and TAs to do a review of these estimates in the middle of the course (a mid-term review of hours). This review is meant to allow the instructor and TA to revise the initial estimated allocation of hours for each duty in light of how long it actually took the TA to perform the work, so that you have a better idea of how to use your time for the rest of the course. It is not meant to be a reflection of your performance as a TA.

For this to function as a system which prevents overwork, it is important that you keep an accurate record of how long it takes you to complete tasks in the purview of your TA contract. Be honest; do not round your grading time down from how long it actually took you.

If students keep you for 15 minutes after tutorial with questions, keep track of the time you spend talking to them and record it in your total. (If this becomes problematic, direct students to office hours for those questions and/or inform your instructor). Use the DDAH form as a semi-flexible guide for how to spend your time, but treat your hours limitation as a law. Don't work more hours than you have been asked to. If you feel you will run out of hours before finishing the expected work, inform your instructor. There may be another TA in the course who has more hours available, or sometimes the department can fund additional TA hours. Do not resign yourself to doing work that you will not be paid for; this perpetuates a problem where more work is expected given the same number or hours (or fewer).

If you find it difficult to communicate with your instructor about overwork and/or you feel you have been asked to accomplish an impossible amount of work in the allotted time, get in touch with one of the linguistics department stewards.

# Research assistantships and other work

Contract research assistant (RA) positions are also unionized, but as part of the USW Local 1998 casual unit. This union represents a variety of administrative positions across the university. The collective agreement can be found here; it covers some basic protections such as a minimum wage threshold, some acceptable leaves of absence, and harassment protection/workplace safety. If you are a research assistant, or are employed under some other kind of casual contract with the department/university, you are likely a member of this union.
