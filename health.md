## Insurance Plans

#### Our insurance coverage period runs for the academic year (September 1 to August 31). There are three levels of health insurance:

* Basic: All graduate students must have some form of basic provincial health care (OHIP if from Ontario; equivalent provincial/territorial coverage if from elsewhere in Canada; UHIP for international students). This covers basic doctor's appointments and hospital visits.

* GSU supplement: Additional health and dental benefits are provided by the https://www.utgsu.ca/ U of T Graduate Students' Union for all full-time and part-time graduate students. The premium is part of the cost of tuition and fees that you pay each year. Your insurance number for the GSU supplement is: UTG[your student number]-00

* CUPE top-up:Each year, all students with a CUPE 3901, Unit 1 appointment of at least 50 hours receive a top-up insurance plan to further supplement their GSU insurance. This comes with a $300 spending account for additional healthcare costs. If your contract in the first term is for fewer than 50 hours, coverage is not available to you until you begin a contract that increases your total. However, regardless of when the coverage kicks in, it is retroactive to September 1 of that year. If you are not enrolled in the GSU plan, you will only have access to the $300 spending account. Your insurance number for the CUPE top-up is: UOT[your employee number]-00
