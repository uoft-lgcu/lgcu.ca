Please note: the current page is under construction, and has not been updated recently. The information it contains is broadly accurate, but should be verified before being relied upon, particular with regards to: amounts covered by healthcare plans, and anything that might be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. travel insurance).

## Insurance Plans

Our insurance coverage period runs for the academic year (September 1 to August 31). There are three levels of health insurance:

* Basic: All graduate students must have some form of basic provincial health care ([OHIP](https://www.ontario.ca/page/what-ohip-covers) if from Ontario; equivalent provincial/territorial coverage if from elsewhere in Canada; [UHIP](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/university-health-insurance-program/) for international students). This covers basic doctor's appointments and hospital visits.

* [GSU supplement:](http://www.studentcare.ca/View.aspx?locale=en&uid=IHaveAPlan_UniversityofTorontoGraduateStudentsUnionUTGSU_Home&) Additional health and dental benefits are provided by the [U of T Graduate Students' Union](https://www.utgsu.ca/) for all full-time and part-time graduate students. The premium is part of the cost of tuition and fees that you pay each year. Your insurance number for the GSU supplement is: UTG[your student number]-00

* [CUPE top-up:](https://www.cupe3902.org/unit-1/benefits/) Each year, all students with a CUPE 3901, Unit 1 appointment of at least 50 hours receive a top-up insurance plan to further supplement their GSU insurance. This comes with a $300 spending account for additional healthcare costs. If your contract in the first term is for fewer than 50 hours, coverage is not available to you until you begin a contract that increases your total. However, regardless of when the coverage kicks in, it is retroactive to September 1 of that year. If you are not enrolled in the GSU plan, you will only have access to the $300 spending account. Your insurance number for the CUPE top-up is: UOT[your employee number]-00

## Benefits

We can receive up to $10,000 in prescription drug costs and $45 per appointment for paramedical services, among other types of coverage. The GSU plan includes an extensive travel insurance component. For a full list of benefits, review these summaries:

* [GSU plan brochure](http://www.ihaveaplan.ca/RTEContent/Document/EN/Brochure/Current_UTGSU.pdf)

* [GSU benefit booklet](http://www.studentcare.ca/RTEContent/Document/EN/Miscellaneous/UTGSU_benefit_booklet.pdf)

* [Top-up plan FAQ](https://www.cupe3902.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Benefits-FAQ.pdf)

* [Maximum allowable amounts](https://www.cupe3902.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GSU_Unit1TopUp_2016-17Coverage_table.pdf)

* [HCSA allowable expenses](https://www.cupe3902.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/HCSA-Allowed-Expenses.pdf)

Unfortunately, the descriptions of benefits can sometimes be vague. If you're not certain whether a particular service will be covered, or what amount will be covered, it's a good idea to contact Green Shield Canada directly to verify *before* paying out of pocket. The phone number for Green Shield Canada is 1-888-711-1119; be sure to have the insurance numbers for both your plans at hand when you call. 

Some healthcare providers are able to apply insurance benefits on the spot so you never have to pay the full cost. Discuss this directly with your healthcare provider(s), and see whether they will coordinate benefits with both your GSU and CUPE plans, or with only one (always apply the GSU benefits first). Take your insurance numbers with you to every medical appointment in order to increase the likelihood of using your benefits as you go.

## Filing a Claim

If you have paid for some kind of health service or prescription without accessing your insurance up front, you can likely receive reimbursement for some of the expense. This is done by filing an insurance claim. You can file a joint claim to both supplementary health plans simultaneously, or file independent claims to each plan. Always apply to the GSU plan first. If your medical expense is not fully covered by the combined supplementary and top-up plans, you can also access your health care spending account (HCSA) which may cover the remainder. Where receipts are required, attach receipts, not just invoices. Coordinated forms can be found in the lounge under the light-switches. If these run low, please be a good citizen and photocopy some more.

Single claim forms (paper or online submission) can be found on the [Greenshield online portal](https://onlineservices.greenshield.ca/planmember/AccessMgmt/Public/SignOn.aspx). It's convenient to sign up for online login to your Greenshield plans. You will need a different login for each insurance number. There you will be able to view claim history, find blank claim forms, submit some kinds of claims, and sign up for direct deposit. Signing up for direct deposit will allow the insurance provider to deposit the amount into your bank account directly. If you do not sign up for direct deposit, a cheque will be mailed to you. Make sure you submit claims for money you spend on your health! Otherwise the insurance company is simply profiting off you. Our plan is pretty good, so use it.

## Canadian Students from Outside Ontario

* (information to be added)

## International Students

International students need to register for a special form of basic health coverage ([UHIP](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/university-health-insurance-program/)). The pool of health providers that take UHIP coverage is more limited than those who take OHIP; when finding a health care provider or trying to get a referral, always check whether or not the provider takes UHIP. While OHIP is paid for through your provincial taxes, UHIP is not. Fees for UHIP are part of the cost of tuition and fees, and should be covered by the department if you are currently funded. If you are not currently funded and have to pay for UHIP out of pocket, you can apply for [CUPE 3902's UHIP reimbursement fund](https://www.cupe3902.org/unit-1/benefits/ihpaf/).

## Partners and Families

It is possible to extend all insurance plans for which you are eligible to your partner and dependents. To do this, you must sign up for [family coverage](https://www.studentcare.ca/rte/en/IHaveAPlan_UniversityofTorontoGraduateStudentsUnionUTGSU_ChangeofCoverage_CoupleFamilyEnrolments) on the GSU insurance plan and pay the additional fee(s). Health and dental are dealt with separately. You must opt-in by the deadline, usually the end of September.

The CUPE plan is currently linked to the GSU plan. If you are eligible for the CUPE top-up plan, this top-up will be extended to all your partners/dependents who also have GSU insurance. The health care spending account will be shared between all members of the family; the Family HCSA has an increased value ($600 as of the 2018-19 academic year.)

Any partners/dependents on your plan will have their own individual ID number. This number is the same as the UTG[student number] and UOT[employee number] IDs that you have as an individual, but instead of -00, your partner's/dependents' numbers will end in -01, -02, etc. When submitting a claim, make sure the ID number reflects the family member who received the medical care.

If you enroll family members on your health plan, you may be able to geta percentage of the cost of adding them to the plan reimbursed through the [U.ofT. Family Plan Assistance Fund](https://www.cupe3902.org/unit-1/benefits/ufpaf/). Applications for this fund are usually open in February, check the website to see if you're available.

If you have an alternative source of equivalent (or better) coverage from your partner or family that you prefer to use rather than this insurance system, you can [opt out](https://utgsu.ca/health-and-dental/opting-out-opting-in/) of the GSU plan. You will be opted out of the CUPE plan by extension (though you will still have access to the health care spending account, if you are eligible for it). Opting-out is done online, through the links on the [studentcare](https://www.studentcare.ca/rte/en/IHaveAPlan_UniversityofTorontoGraduateStudentsUnionUTGSU_ChangeofCoverage_OptOuts) page. You must opt-out by the deadline, usually the end of September.

Greenshield has agreements with healthcare providers in the city (and around the country) that will lower the cost of some services. You can also find nearby health providers through the classic method of asking your peers things like, "Do you like your dentist?" or "Where did you get your glasses?" There are also more informal mental wellness resources, like the GSU's [Grad Minds](http://www.gradminds.ca/) or the LGCU's own [Mindsweepers Wellness Committee](https://uoft-lgcu.github.io/committees/), which tackles general issues of grad student mental health. You can send them suggestions or get involved yourself!

## Other Tips

#### Timelines: 
Expenses must be incurred between September 1 and August 31 for that year. You cannot submit an expense more than 12 months old and expect to receive payment.

#### Graduation:
If you have graduated, congratulations! If you still need health insurance, you can extend your GSU insurance plan for 12 months at the same rate.

#### Travel: 
Before going on any international travel related to your work, the university requires you to have travel insurance. The GSU plan includes [full travel insurance](https://www.utgsu.ca/insurance/travel-insurance-emergency-medical-coverage/) for trips of up to 120 days that can cover you for conferences, research trips, or almost any other conceivable reason. Do not buy additional travel insurance!

#### Claiming the premium:
Those who do not have medical expenses can currently still access their HCSA by submitting the cost of your GSU health care premium (listed among your fees on ROSI/Acorn) as a health expense to be reimbursed. The HCSA will not cover the full cost, but you may as well access the money since this is possible.

#### Convenience:
[Print your own insurance card](https://www.utgsu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/UTGSU_PayDirectCard.pdf) to carry around; you can also find copies of this in the lounge under the light switches. Write your GSU plan number in the box and CUPE plan number below or on the other side. Consider laminating the card, printing it out on cardboard, or using tape. So crafty!
