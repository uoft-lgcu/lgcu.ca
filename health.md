## Insurance Plans

Our insurance coverage period runs for the academic year (September 1 to August 31). There are three levels of health insurance:

* Basic: All graduate students must have some form of basic provincial health care ([OHIP](https://www.ontario.ca/page/what-ohip-covers "Ontario Government information on what OHIP covers") if from Ontario; equivalent provincial/territorial coverage if from elsewhere in Canada; [UHIP](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/university-health-insurance-program/ "U of T information on UHIP") for international students). This covers basic doctor's appointments and hospital visits.

* [GSU supplement:](http://www.studentcare.ca/View.aspx?locale=en&uid=IHaveAPlan_UniversityofTorontoGraduateStudentsUnionUTGSU_Home& "UTGSU Health Plan main page at studentcare.ca") Additional health and dental benefits are provided by the [U of T Graduate Students' Union](https://utgsu.ca/health-and-dental/ "UTGSU Health and Dental information") for all full-time and part-time graduate students. The premium is part of the cost of tuition and fees that you pay each year. Your insurance number for the GSU supplement is: UTG[your student number]-00

* [CUPE top-up:](https://www.cupe3902.org/unit-1/benefits/ "CUPE3902 Unit 1 Benefits") Each year, all students with a CUPE 3902, Unit 1 appointment of at least 30 hours receive a top-up insurance plan to further supplement their GSU insurance. This comes with the HCSA for additional healthcare costs. If your contract in the first term is for fewer than 30 hours, coverage is not available to you until you begin a contract that increases your total. However, regardless of when the coverage kicks in, it is retroactive to September 1 of that year. If you are not enrolled in the GSU plan, you will only have access to the HCSA spending account. Your insurance number for the CUPE top-up is: UOT[your employee number]-00

Both the GSU plan and the CUPE top-up plan are through the same company: Green Shield Canada. The GSU plan is considered your 'primary' plan, and the top-up plan is used to cover costs that aren't fully covered by the GSU plan. For example: If both plans cover prescription drugs at 80%, the GSU plan would cover 80% of the total, and the top-up plan would cover the remaining 20% (since it's 80% of the total, not 80% of the remaining amount).

## Benefits

The GSU plan and the CUPE top-up plan together cover a wide variety of health care services. For a full list of benefits, you can review these summaries:

* [GSU plan brochure](http://www.ihaveaplan.ca/RTEContent/Document/EN/Brochure/Current_UTGSU.pdf "UTGSU Health and Dental Brochure (pdf)")

* [GSU benefit booklet](http://www.studentcare.ca/RTEContent/Document/EN/Miscellaneous/UTGSU_benefit_booklet.pdf "UTGSU Health and Dental Benefits Booklet (pdf)")

* [CUPE Top-up plan pamphlet](https://www.cupe3902.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CUPE-3902-UNIT-1-TOP-UP-PLAN-PAMPHLET.pdf.pdf "CUPE3902 What you need to know pamphlet (pdf)")

* [CUPE Unit 1 Benefits](https://www.cupe3902.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017-18-Unit-1-Benefits-Funds.pdf "CUPE3902 Unit 1 Benefits brochure (pdf)")

* [Top-up plan FAQ](https://www.cupe3902.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Benefits-FAQ.pdf "CUPE3902 Unit 1 Health Benefits FAQ (pdf)")

* [Summary of Coverage Amounts for Both Plans](https://www.cupe3902.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GSU_Unit1TopUp_2016-17Coverage_table.pdf "Table of maximum amounts that can be claimed for both health plans (pdf)")

* [HCSA allowable expenses](http://assets.greenshield.ca/greenshield/Plan%20Members/Benefits%20Dictionary/hcsa-eng/Eligible%20HCSA%20Expenses%20(Website).pdf "List of expenses that can be reimbursed from the HCSA (pdf)")

Unfortunately, the descriptions of benefits can sometimes be vague. If you're not certain whether a particular service will be covered, or what amount will be covered, it's a good idea to contact Green Shield Canada directly to verify **before** paying out of pocket. The phone number for Green Shield Canada is 1-888-711-1119; be sure to have the insurance numbers for both your plans at hand when you call.

### What kinds of things are covered?

Here are some examples of benefits included in our plans (remember to always check the details of coverage before paying out-of-pocket):

* Prescription drugs

* Psychotherapy and counselling

* Custom foot orthotics

* Diabetic equipment

* Prescription glasses or contacts

* Laser eye surgery

* Preventative, restorative and emergency dental services

* Registered massage therapy

* Physiotherapy

Many students under-use their health care coverage; this only benefits the insurance company. Make sure you're getting the most out of the benefits you're paying for, and don't put off medical care for financial reasons when you don't have to!

## Paying direct

Some healthcare providers are able to apply insurance benefits on the spot so you never have to pay the full cost. Discuss this directly with your healthcare provider(s), and see whether they will coordinate benefits with both your GSU and CUPE plans, or with only one (always apply the GSU benefits first). Take your insurance numbers with you to every medical appointment in order to increase the likelihood of using your benefits as you go.

You can also [print your own insurance card](https://www.studentcare.ca/RTEContent/Document/EN/Pay_Direct/UTGSU_PDC.pdf "UTGSU Health and dental plan pay-direct card (pdf)") to carry around. Write your GSU plan number in the box and CUPE plan number below or on the other side. Consider laminating the card, printing it out on cardboard, or using tape.

## Filing a claim

If you have paid for some kind of health service or prescription without accessing your insurance up front, you can likely receive reimbursement for some of the expense. This is done by filing an insurance claim. You can file a joint claim to both supplementary health plans simultaneously, or file independent claims to each plan. Always apply to the GSU plan first. If your medical expense is not fully covered by the combined supplementary and top-up plans, you can also access your health care spending account (HCSA) which may cover the remainder. Where receipts are required, attach receipts, not just invoices. Coordinated forms can be found in the lounge under the light-switches. If these run low, please be a good citizen and photocopy some more.

Single claim forms (paper or online submission) can be found on the [Greenshield online portal](https://onlineservices.greenshield.ca/planmember/AccessMgmt/Public/SignOn.aspx "Green Shield plan member online services login page"). It's convenient to sign up for online login to your Greenshield plans. You will need a different login for each insurance number. There you will be able to view claim history, find blank claim forms, submit some kinds of claims, and sign up for direct deposit. Signing up for direct deposit will allow the insurance provider to deposit the amount into your bank account directly. If you do not sign up for direct deposit, a cheque will be mailed to you. Make sure you submit claims for money you spend on your health! Otherwise the insurance company is simply profiting off you. Our plan is pretty good, so use it.

## International Students

International students need to register for a special form of basic health coverage ([UHIP](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/university-health-insurance-program/ "U of T information on UHIP")). The pool of health providers that take UHIP coverage is more limited than those who take OHIP; when finding a health care provider or trying to get a referral, always check whether or not the provider takes UHIP. While OHIP is paid for through your provincial taxes, UHIP is not. Fees for UHIP are part of the cost of tuition and fees, and should be covered by the department if you are currently funded. If you are not currently funded and have to pay for UHIP out of pocket, you can apply for [CUPE 3902's UHIP reimbursement fund](https://www.cupe3902.org/unit-1/benefits/ihpaf/ "CUPE's International Health Plan Assistance Fund: who's eligible and how to apply").

## Partners and Families

It is possible to extend all insurance plans for which you are eligible to your spouse and any dependent children (common-law and same-sex partners are included, and you may only cover one spouse at a time; verify [who's eligible to enroll](https://studentcare.ca/rte/en/IHaveAPlan_UniversityofTorontoGraduateStudentsUnionUTGSU_ChangeofCoverage_CoupleFamilyEnrolments_WhosEligible "Studentcare information on couple and family enrollment eligibility"). To do this, you must sign up for [family coverage](https://www.studentcare.ca/rte/en/IHaveAPlan_UniversityofTorontoGraduateStudentsUnionUTGSU_ChangeofCoverage_CoupleFamilyEnrolments "How to apply for couple and family enrollment") on the GSU insurance plan and pay the additional fee(s). Health and dental are dealt with separately. You must opt-in by the deadline, usually the end of September.

The CUPE plan is currently linked to the GSU plan. If you are eligible for the CUPE top-up plan, this top-up will be extended to all your family members who also have GSU insurance. The health care spending account will be shared between all members of the family; the Family HCSA has an increased value.

Any family members on your plan will have their own individual ID number. This number is the same as the UTG[student number] and UOT[employee number] IDs that you have as an individual, but instead of -00, your family members' numbers will end in -01, -02, etc. When submitting a claim, make sure the ID number reflects the family member who received the medical care.

If you enroll family members on your health plan, you may be able to get a percentage of their premiums reimbursed through the [U of T Family Plan Assistance Fund](https://www.cupe3902.org/unit-1/benefits/ufpaf/ "CUPE's UofT Family Plan Assistance Fund: who's eligible and how to apply"). Applications for this fund are usually open in February, check the website to see if you're eligible.

If you have an alternative source of equivalent (or better) coverage from your partner or family that you prefer to use rather than this insurance system, you can [opt-out](https://utgsu.ca/health-and-dental/opting-out-opting-in/ "How to opt-in or opt-out of GSU health care") of the GSU plan. You will be opted out of the CUPE plan by extension (though you will still have access to the health care spending account, if you are eligible for it). Opting-out is done online, through the links on the [studentcare](https://www.studentcare.ca/rte/en/IHaveAPlan_UniversityofTorontoGraduateStudentsUnionUTGSU_ChangeofCoverage_OptOuts "Studentcare information on how to opt-out of the health plan") page. You must opt-out by the deadline, usually the end of September.

You can also optionally authorize up to four people to contact Green Shield on your behalf to inquire or update about the details of the benefits plan (do so when signed in to the Green Shield online portal, under "My Profile"). Individuals **do not** have to be enrolled on your plan as family members to be authorized this way. You will still have to authorize and/or sign submitted claims as the primary plan holder, however.

## Health Services

The U of T offers a variety of on-campus health services, including general family doctor-type services, [sexual and reproductive health support](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/sexual-and-reproductive-health-counselling-and-education/ "U of T Health and Wellness sexual and reproductive health counselling and education"), [mental health care](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/mental-health-care/ "U of T Health and Wellness mental health care"), [disability documentation](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/disability-documentation/ "U of T Health and Wellness disability documentation"), [immunizations](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/immunization-services/ "U of T Health and Wellness immunization services"), and many more. 

Note: U of T Health and Wellness typically offers flu shots, but will not be doing so for the 2020-21 year. You can still get a free flu shot through [Toronto Public Health](https://www.toronto.ca/311/knowledgebase/kb/docs/articles/public-health/communicable-disease-control/vaccine-preventable-disease/flu-shot-clinics-seasonal-flu-when-and-where-to-get-your-flu-shot.html "City of Toronto: where and when to get your seasonal flu shot") as well as [other services](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/flu-clinic-referrals/ "U of T Health and Wellness information on how and where to get a flu shot").

#### Studentcare Network:

Green Shield has agreements with healthcare providers in the city (and around the country) that will lower the cost of some services for plan members. You can look through the [complete list of in-network providers](https://www.studentcare.ca/RTEContent/Document/EN/Network_Listings/ON_3_Studentcare.pdf "Full list of health plan providers for all networks (pdf)"), or check details of the discounts and providers for each network on the [studentcare website](https://www.studentcare.ca/rte/en/IHaveAPlan_UniversityofTorontoGraduateStudentsUnionUTGSU_Home "UTGSU Health plan main page, look in the right-hand column under 'studentcare networks'") (on the right-hand side, under "Studentcare Networks". **You do not have to use an in-network provider to get reimbursed**; your coverage applies equally to all qualified providers, being "in the network" just means a provider will offer discounts on some services to plan members.

If you're not sure if the provider you want to see will be covered by your plan, you can check the [GSU benefit booklet](http://www.studentcare.ca/RTEContent/Document/EN/Miscellaneous/UTGSU_benefit_booklet.pdf "UTGSU Health plan detailed benefits booklet"), or contact Green Shield directly through their [support centre](https://support.greenshield.ca/SupportCentre/GreenShield?culture=en-CA "Green Shield Canada online support centre, search for existing questions"), [online form](https://onlineservices.greenshield.ca/PlanMember/AccessMgmt/Public/AnonymousInquiry.aspx?lang=en-CA "Green Shield Canada 'contact us' online form") or at 1-888-711-1119. This is primarily an issue with professional services (such as counselling), where providers must have certain qualifications in order to be covered by the plan.

#### Other ways to find resources:

* Your fellow grad students can be a great source of advice and support (even if it's just about what dentist they go to). To get in touch in the age of social distancing, you can: email the LGCU listserv (LGCU-L@listserv.utoronto.ca); contact [Fiona Wilson](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/graduate-students/fiona-wilson "Linguistics Department People entry for Fiona Wilson") to be added to the LGCUers facebook page; or contact [Tim Gadanidis](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/graduate-students/timothy-gadanidis "Linguistics Department People entry for Timothy Gadanidis") to be added to the LGCU virtual lounge on Zulip.

* The LGCU's own [Mindsweepers Wellness Committee](https://uoft-lgcu.github.io/committees/ "LGCU Committees page") 
Mindsweepers **does not** provide direct support to students, but may be able to point you in the direction of some good resources. You can send them suggestions or get involved yourself.

## Other Tips

#### Timelines: 
Expenses must be incurred between September 1 and August 31 for the year that you are enrolled in the plan. Expenses for the past year should ideally be submitted for reimbursement before your plan ends on August 31. There is a 30-day "grace period" (i.e. until the end of September after your plan year ends), when you can still submit outstanding expenses, but because Green Shield doesn't consider your top-up plan to be "active" during this time (it's within the blackout dates), submitting claims during the grace period can be more challenging (see [Filing a Claim](https://github.com/uoft-lgcu/uoft-lgcu.github.io/blob/main/health.md#filing-a-claim "Section on 'Filing a Claim' on this page")). Best course of action: submit whatever expenses you can before August 31, and only send claims in during the grace period if you have to.

During the first few months of the new academic year (for GSU members, usually from September until early November), your CUPE top-up plan will be under blackout. CUPE members are only eligible for the top-up plan after they have reached a certain number of hours, and then it may take some time for Green Shield to receive and process the information about your plan status from U of T. This means that during this time, you won't be able to get reimbursed for expenses from the CUPE top-up plan (the GSU plan should still work), and claims will come back 'denied' if you send them in. Save your receipts, and submit the claims **after** the blackout period ends. Even if the GSU plan has already paid a portion of the expense, you can still get reimbursed for the amount that the top-up plan covers later.

#### Graduation:
If you are graduating in the Fall semester (i.e. before January), you will not be charged winter fees and your coverage will automatically end on December 31st. If you are graduating in the Winter or Summer semester (i.e. in or after January), you will already have paid winter fees, so your coverage will end on August 31st.

You do have the option to extend your coverage, however. At the end of the last term you pay fees for, you can purchase a [12-month extension](https://www.studentcare.ca/rte/en/IHaveAPlan_UniversityofTorontoGraduateStudentsUnionUTGSU_ChangeofCoverage_12MonthExtendedCoverage "UTGSU 12-month extended insurance information"). You have to apply for this extended coverage within 30 days of the termination of your UTGSU insurance (i.e. the end of the last term you paid fees for). Fill out [the application form](https://www.studentcare.ca/RTEContent/Document/EN/Enrolment_Forms/UTGSU_12MonthExt.pdf "UTGSU 12-month extended insurance application form (pdf)") and submit the fees by cheque or money order by the deadline.

Other things to note:

* The 12-month extended coverage is typically more expensive than the fees charged to graduate students for the plan (for 2020-21, it was approximately 50% more expensive)

* Partners and dependents can also be enrolled for 12-month extended coverage

* The 12-month extended plan includes the HCSA, which can be claimed back against the premium (see [HCSA details](https://github.com/uoft-lgcu/uoft-lgcu.github.io/blob/main/health.md#HCSA-details: "Section on 'HCSA details' on this page"))

* (This bullet point under construction - Access to the CUPE top-up plan)

* Former LGCU members who used the extension have **strongly** recommended purchasing it 

#### Going on leave:

* This section is still under construction, but here is some information on the [leave provisions in the Unit 1 collective agreement](https://www.cupe3902.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Leaves-Info-2018-2019.pdf "CUPE3902 Unit 1 Leave Provisions information sheet (pdf)")

#### Travel: 
Before going on any international travel related to your work, the university requires you to have travel insurance. The GSU plan includes [full travel insurance](https://utgsu.ca/health-and-dental/travel-insurance/ "UTGSU travel insurance coverage") for trips of up to 120 days that can cover you for conferences, research trips, many other reasons.

Due to COVID-19, however, travel advisories and insurance coverage can change quickly. For this reason, we are **strongly recommending** that you verify your coverage before travelling outside of Canada. Check with the [Green Shield COVID-19 FAQ](https://support.greenshield.ca/SupportCentre/GreenShield/Home/DocumentsByTopic/region_coronavirus "Green Shield Canada support centre search results for 'Coronavirus (COVID-19)'"), as well as the Government of Canada [official travel advisories](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories "Government of Canada Travel advice and advisories") and [COVID-19 travel restrictions and advice](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html "Government of Canada Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Travel restrictions, exemptions and advice") for up-to-date information.

#### HCSA details:

The HCSA is a undifferentiated pool of funds associated with your CUPE top-up plan. It can be used to pay for health care not otherwise covered by provincial health care or your plans' benefits. A [wide variety of expenses](http://assets.greenshield.ca/greenshield/Plan%20Members/Benefits%20Dictionary/hcsa-eng/Eligible%20HCSA%20Expenses%20(Website).pdf "Eligible HCSA Expenses (pdf)") can be paid for using the HCSA. Like the rest of your health care benefits, this fund does not roll over into the following year; any amount not used by August 31st of the plan year is lost.

You can set your plan to automatically have any unpaid health and dental expenses paid for out of the HCSA. This can be done by logging in to your Green Shield portal top-up plan account and looking under "My Spending Accounts". While this is quite convenient, there are potential downsides. You may not notice if the insurance provider wrongly rejects your valid expense claim, and then takes the money to reimburse you out of the HCSA account instead. Automation may also make it appear to some health care providers running a pre-authorization that you have more coverage than you actually do! If you choose to set up automation, make sure to keep an eye on how those funds are being disbursed.

You can also directly submit claims for reimbursement to the HCSA. Eligible claims include the cost of you or your family's GSU health care premiums! Your own premium will be listed among your fees on ROSI/Acorn, enrolled family member fees can be found in the email confirmation sent to you when you pay. The HCSA alone will not cover the full cost of premiums, but this is a useful way to make use of any remaining HCSA funds when the end of the year approaches. Remember not to submit any family member's premium costs to the HCSA if you're going to be applying for the [U of T Family Plan Assistance Fund](https://www.cupe3902.org/unit-1/benefits/ufpaf/ "CUPE's UofT Family Plan Assistance Fund: who's eligible and how to apply") (application usually open in February).
