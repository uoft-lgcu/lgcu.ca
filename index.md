# About the LGCU

All of the students enrolled in graduate programs offered by the Department of
Linguistics at the University of Toronto are automatically members of the
Linguistics Graduate Course Union, as well as the university-wide Graduate
Student Union (GSU). The GSU represents graduate students across the University
of Toronto. The LGCU is focused on the experiences of graduate students within
the Department of Linguistics.

We work with the rest of the department to improve the graduate experience. We
also organize and host academic conferences, tutor undergraduates, provide TA
training, maintain a book collection, and edit Toronto Working Papers in
Linguistics (TWPL).

Thanks to TA-ships and instructorships, almost all of the graduate students in
the department are also members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees
(CUPE). CUPE 3902 advocates for graduate student employees (and many other
contract academic workers!) who teach, grade, invigilate, etc. at the University
of Toronto.
