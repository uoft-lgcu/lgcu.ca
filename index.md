# About the LGCU

All of the students enrolled in graduate programs offered by the Department of
Linguistics at the University of Toronto are automatically members of the
Linguistics Graduate Course Union, as well as the university-wide Graduate
Student Union (GSU).

Thanks to TA-ships and instructorships, almost all of the graduate stuents in
the department are also members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees
(CUPE). CUPE advocates for graduate student employees at the national and
provincial levels; the GSU represents graduate students across the University of
Toronto. The LGCU is focused on the experiences of graduate students within the
Department of Linguistics.

We work with the rest of the department to improve the graduate experience. We
also organize and host academic conferences, tutor undergraduates, provide TA
training, maintain a book collection, and edit Toronto Working Papers in
Linguistics (TWPL).
