# About the LGCU

All of the students enrolled in graduate programs offered by the Department of
Linguistics at the University of Toronto are automatically members of the
Linguistics Graduate Course Union, as well as the university-wide Graduate
Student Union (GSU).

Thanks to TA-ships and instructorships, almost all of the graduate students in
the department are also members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees
(CUPE). CUPE 3902 advocates for graduate student employees at the University of
Toronto (and many other contract academic workers!); the GSU represents graduate
students across the University of Toronto. The LGCU is focused on the
experiences of graduate students within the Department of Linguistics.

We work with the rest of the department to improve the graduate experience. We
also organize and host academic conferences, tutor undergraduates, provide TA
training, maintain a book collection, and edit Toronto Working Papers in
Linguistics (TWPL).
