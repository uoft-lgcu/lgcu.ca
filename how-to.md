# How to...

## Print at the Department

There are two general-use printers in the department. PiSheng is upstairs in the mail room; Alcuin is downstairs in room 568. Neither printer has user codes set up, this means that you can print remotely from any device, as long as you have the IP addresses and appropriate drivers installed. (If you don't have the IP addresses, ask one of your fellow grad students).

**Note:** You can also print files from a USB device. Only printer-ready files (like pdfs) cab be printed this way. Just plug in your USB to the port on the front of the printer, and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Accessing the Printers Through a Browser

If you're on a device you can't (or don't want to) install drivers on, or are having technical difficulties, you can print directly through a browser using the IP addresses.

Use the URL: "http://[IP ADDRESS]/"

Click on the Print tab; you will be able to browse for a file and submit it for printing. Like with printing from a USB, this will only work for printer-ready files like pdfs.

### Setting Up Printing on Your Device

1. Download the necessary drivers. The drivers are available from [the Xerox Support page linked here](www.support.xerox.com/support/workcentre-5735-5740-5745-5755/downloads/enus.html "Xerox Support Workcentre downloads"), or search the Xerox website for drivers for the **Xerox WorkCentre 5745**. Select your OS from the dropdown menu. For OSX, you only have one driver package to choose from; for Windows, you have a few options. In the past, the PCL6 driver has been recommended; however, recent reports suggest that this is no longer ideal. Try the web-based installer or the global driver instead for now. Linux users will need a modified .ppd for use with CUPS (available through [this dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cb0xfz8rllpdrs0/xr_WorkCentre5735.ppd "Dropbox link for a modified .ppd file for Linux users") (some users have had trouble getting this to work; remember that accessing the printers through the browser method above is always an option).

2. Click on the package you've downloaded and start installing it. In the options that follow, be sure to select the option for a **network printer** or **LPR printer**. Don't search the network for a printer (you won't find one), just supply the IP address for the printer.

3. If you want to set up printing for both printers, you should be able to just add a new network printer through your control panel / settings (giving it the other IP address) and have it find the necessary drivers.

## Book a Room

## Access the Grad Calendars

The [calendar](https://uoft-lgcu.github.io/calendar/ "LGCU Website Events Page") takes its information from the current grad student calendars. These are stored in the gmail account gradroom568@gmail.com (ask another grad student for password).

It's possible to check and edit the calendars just by signing in to the gmail account directly, but this is not recommended. Gmail gets upset after too many sign-ins from different devices and will refuse to sign you in without access to the recovery email. This means no one can access the account until we track down who is the current recovery email for the account (usually a member of the LGCU executive) and get them to open things up again. It's super annoying. Therefore, don't habitually use the gradroom568 account for booking, etc., but instead sign in once and share the calendars you want with your own gmail account, so you can access them that way.

### To share the calendar with yourself

1. Sign in to gmail using the "gradroom568@gmail.com" account (and the password you've sourced already)

2. Click on the "google apps" icon in the top right corner of the page, and select "calendar" from the drop-down menu

3. In the left scroll-bar, there should be a selection of independent calendars (e.g. Multi-purpose Room, Projector Booking, etc.) For each calendar you want access to, click on 'options' (three dots that will appear when you hover over the calendar name).

4. Select "Settings and Sharing"; under "Share with specific people" you'll see a list of people the calendar is shared with. Scroll to the bottom of that list, and click "+ Add people".

5. Input your gmail account into the prompt that pops up and select "send". The calendar should now be shared with your gmail account, and you should be able to see and edit it without signing in to the gradroom568 account.

6. Repeat the last three steps for any other grad calendars you want access to.
