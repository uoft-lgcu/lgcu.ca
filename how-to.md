## Access the Grad Calendars

The [calendar](https://uoft-lgcu.github.io/calendar/ "LGCU Website Events Page") takes its information from the current grad student calendars. These are stored in the gmail account gradroom568@gmail.com (ask another grad student for password).

It's possible to check and edit the calendars just by signing in to the gmail account directly, but this is not recommended. Gmail gets upset after too many sign-ins from different devices and will refuse to sign you in without access to the recovery email. This means no one can access the account until we track down who is the current recovery email for the account (usually a member of the LGCU executive) and get them to open things up again. It's super annoying. Therefore, don't habitually use the gradroom568 account for booking, etc., but instead sign in once and share the calendars you want with your own gmail account, so you can access them that way.

### To share the calendar with yourself

* Sign in to gmail using the "gradroom568@gmail.com" account (and the password you've sourced already)

* Click on the "google apps" icon in the top right corner of the page, and select "calendar" from the drop-down menu

* In the left scroll-bar, there should be a selection of independent calendars (e.g. Multi-purpose Room, Projector Booking, etc.) For each calendar you want access to, click on 'options' (three dots that will appear when you hover over the calendar name).

* Select "Settings and Sharing"; under "Share with specific people" you'll see a list of people the calendar is shared with. Scroll to the bottom of that list, and click "+ Add people".

* Input your gmail account into the prompt that pops up and select "send". The calendar should now be shared with your gmail account, and you should be able to see and edit it without signing in to the gradroom568 account.

* Repeat the last three steps for any other grad calendars you want access to.
