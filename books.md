The Linguistics Department maintains a collection of books, journals, and working papers/conference proceedings, which is kept in three different places: the department lounge (journals and some conference proceedings), SS569 (other conference proceedings), and SS4069 (books).

Books can be signed out by current departmental members: use the form on the clipboard that is normally located near the cabinet containing the U of T Ph.D. theses. A link to the library catalogue is available for anyone affiliated with the Department of Linguistics (e.g., as a graduate student, faculty member, or post-doctoral researcher); email Ross Godfrey for the link.

New books are acquired through donations. Most commonly they are donated either by a faculty member, or by the LGCU. The LGCU raises money to purchase new books through the pop and coffee funds.
