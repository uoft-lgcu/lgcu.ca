## Access to the Department

University and Department guidelines may change at any time; be sure to keep an eye out for email updates. At time of writing (05/11/2020), the Linguistics Department is considered **closed**, but we have approval for occasional/required use of space. If you wish to go in, you must:

* Fill out the [UCHECK](https://ucheck.utoronto.ca/ "Direct link to U of T UCHECK login page") symptom checker using your UTORid (Note: the University has confirmed that the final red/green assessment will be sent to a small group at HR; your personal details will not be seen by anyone at the University, for more information, check the [U of T COVID-19 self-assessments page](https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether2020/ucheck "U of T COVID-19 self-assessments information page")).

* Let either the [Department Chair](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/sali-tagliamonte "Linguistics Department People entry for Sali Tagliamonte, current department chair") or the [Departmental Officer](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/staff/mary-hsu "Linguistics Department People entry for Mary Hsu, current departmental officer") know.

* Follow social distancing and sanitation rules as posted.

Note: In addition to the department-wide guidelines, the LGCU voted at the most recent AGM to require members to wear a mask or face covering while in grad spaces (SS568 and SS569) ([exceptions as per City of Toronto bylaw](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/9836-COVID-19-Guidance-on-face-mask-and-covering-bylaw.pdf "City of Toronto COVID-19 guidance on mask and face covering bylaw (pdf)")), including when only one person is present in the space.
