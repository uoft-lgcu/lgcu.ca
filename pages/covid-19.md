## University-wide COVID-19 policies 

As of November 2022, the University has paused its mandatory mask and vaccination requirement indefinitely while strongly encourages the use of masks, as well as for the UofT community memebers to obtain primary and booster shots for COVID. The university has also paused the vaccination, self-screening, and social distancing requirements. 

For the lastest COVID-19 policy update, visit the Environmental Health & Safetly's [COVID-19 information page](https://ehs.utoronto.ca/covid-19-information/) or the [COVID-19 General Workplace Guideline](https://ehs.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MERGED-COVID-19-20220923.pdf).
